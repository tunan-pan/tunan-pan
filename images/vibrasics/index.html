                        <p>Much has happened since the last update over a year ago, <a href="http://mememamo.com/">Ian (Des MC)</a> has left after deciding he could no longer bear the injustice of Dunedin's <strong>instant noodle prices</strong> and departed for the MSG coated shores of Hong Kong. While Aidan's (The odd keyboard guy) sweet tooth and need for legal medical <strong>marijuana</strong> have forced him to take up residency in Canada. Mikey (turntables) likes to munch on whales and it wasn't going down well here, so he has joined a <strong>whale munching</strong> club in Japan.</p>
                        <p>Our new members: Paul Young (saxes), Paul Raine (keys) Oh, and Matt is back on bass.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, until this site is revamped, for a more frequently updated account of our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRWGTRy8Z3w">exploits</a> + tour/gig dates go to our myspace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/vibrasics">www.myspace.com/vibrasics</a></p>

                            <p>So a while back we spent a week away recording our new album in Tautuku. Still plenty of work to be done (go team) but the groundwork is all there and we had wicked mad times doing it, props to the Tautuku massive! <a href="gallery.html">New photos</a> of our Tautuku experience are up. Most importantly however is our massively improved recorded sound, old tracks have been removed from the site and a new track (giving you a taste of the upcoming album) "Grease Stain" is up! <a href="downloads.html">download pure enlightenment now!</a></p>

                            <p>Our photoshoot seems to have been a bit of a disaster. Good ideas but the lighting in most of the shots has us looking whiter than even a Dunedin hip-hop band should look... On the up side, the first part of our <a href="bio.html">bio section</a> is now up, hopefully individual bios will be here soon.</p>
