        	<p>The work of the CPL is often difficult and time-consuming. We always welcome new people who are willing to donate their time and efforts in various ways.</p>
			<p>Volunteer help is needed in the following areas; if you would like to offer help, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_homefeeding"><span>home feeding</span></h2>
			<p>This is a service provided for cat owners away from home and entails feeding their cat(s) etc. A fee, which goes to the CPL, is charged for the service.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_fostercare"><span>foster care - kittens</span></h2>
			<p>Kitten foster care involves caring for the mother cats and their kittens in your own home, until such time as new, permanent homes can be found for them. The CPL provides holding cages if required.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_timid"><span>timid cats with special needs</span></h2>
			<p>We are also looking for kind people with lifestyle blocks to adopt one or more of our timid cats. They may well thrive in that environment.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_transport"><span>miscellaneous transport service</span></h2>
			<p>This is really only an emergency service, in cases where cats need to be collected and taken to the vet, or the CPL shelter, or foster home. It is very useful for us to have people we can call on for this service, although they may only be used occasionally.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_shelterduties"><span>shelter duties</span></h2>
			<p>We have a roster of shelter helpers, and duties include feeding the cats, doing dishes, scooping and cleaning litter trays and general cleaning. We have people going in twice a day and often need stand-in helpers when the regular workers are away or ill, and full-time replacements when roster members leave us.</p>
			
			<h2 class="support_h2" id="support_h2_fundraising"><span>fundraising</span></h2>
			<p>A vital and never-ending priority as the League could not continue to run without constant, vigorous fund-raising. There are many ways in which you can contribute, including donating unwanted goods for stalls and garage sales, baking cakes and making marmalade, jam, pickles, etc. for sale, transporting goods and serving on stalls, knitting, crocheting or making craft items for sale, placing and emptying collection boxes or acting as telephone co-ordinator and collection point for people in your area. Any other ideas for fund-raising are always welcome.</p>
